### Description
In this hack-a-thing I had attempted to learn react and more particularly learn material-ui which is a library that deals with all things relating to user interface. So as a result I had just messed around with the components, adding buttons, lists, appbars and toolbars, and creating textboxes 


### What I learned
I learned alot more javascript, I have no experience in the language, so I felt this was a nice introduction to webdevelopment and hopefully if time permits I would love to expand on what I am learning and take my material UI skills to another level for future Hack-A-Things. Therefore specifically I have learned how to make rudimentary styles, add textboxes and buttons, make lists, use typography, and use grids. 


### What didnt work/shortcomings

I think it would have been nicer to show a cohesive product, as of now I only have examples of what each component can do.
I was not able to set up multiple pages, was getting an unknown error so I would like to explore that a bit more on my own. I also was not able to figure out how exactly to change the webpages background colors.


### Opinion
Overall though I feel that material ui is really worth the learn as it can help in tidying up UI/UX in websites. And there really are a plethora of resources as it is well documented and there are so many people on youtube talking about the library and creating tutorials as well
